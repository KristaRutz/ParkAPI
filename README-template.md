## Description

_README under construction_

This application is the Week 13 Friday independent assignment for Epicodus' full time Intro to Programming and C#/React course.  This is an application made to show building a custom API with full functionality and include a more advanced function.



<!-- _Detailed desc w/ purpose/usage, what does, motivation to create, why exists, other info for users/developers to have_ -->

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_This program requires .NET Core SDK to run. [Here is a free tutorial](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-c-and-net) for installing .NET on Mac or Windows 10 from the [official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/)._ 

_This program also makes use of SQL databases. We recommend using MySQL Workbench to build your databases. [Here is a free tutorial](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql) for installing MySQL WorkBench and MySQL Community Server on Mac (using links [Mac1](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) and [Mac2](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)) or [Windows 10](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919)._

### Requirements to Run
* _.NET Core_
* _ASP.NET Core MVC_
* _MySQL Workbench_
* _MySQL Community Server_
* _Entity Framework_
* _Command Prompt_
* _Web Browser_

### Instructions

<!-- *This application may be viewed by:*

1. Download and install .NET Core from the [official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/)
2. Download and install MySQL Workbench and Community Server for Mac or Windows by following the instructions [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql).
3. Click clone the [repository](https://github.com/TSiu88/HairSalon.git) from my [GitHub page](https://github.com/TSiu88) to copy the repository link
4. Use a command line interface to type `git clone (repository-link-here)` to copy the project into the current folder and then move into the repository's directory that was just created with `cd (project-name-here)`
5. Start up a local server by opening MySQL Workbench and adding a `MySQL Connections` using the default IP address and Port (IP 127.0.0.1, Port 3306), username (root), and password from setup.
6. Run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` in command line interface of the repository's main project directory
7. Run `dotnet run` to start up the program in the command line interface
8. Type the URL listed under "Now listening on:" into a web browser to run -->


## Other Technologies Used
* _C#_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _MSTest_
* _Razor_
* _Markdown_

## Specifications

<!-- <details>
  <summary>Expand to view Specifications</summary>

| Specification | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| The program displays welcome message and menu with prices | Application start | Welcome message and menu displayed |
| The program displays special deals in readable format | Application start | Special deals displayed ("Buy 2, get 1 free" "3 for $5") |
| The program takes input of user that is not an integer, then assume 0 ordered | Bread="aaa", Pastry="" | Bread=0, Pastry=0 |
| The program takes number of loaves of bread and pastries and displays totals | Bread=4, Pastry=4 | Bread=$20, Pastry=$8, Total=$28 |
| If input qualifies for special deals, costs calculated using discounted price | Bread=3, Pastry=3 | Bread=$10, Pastry=$5, Total=$15 |

### Assignment Objectives

<details>
  <summary>Expand to view Assignement Objectives</summary>

**At the very least, your API should include the following:**

* Full CRUD functionality.
* Further exploration of one of the following objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS.
* Complete documentation of API endpoints and the further exploration you did.

#### Objectives:

[ ] Application includes CRUD functionality and successfully returns responses to API calls.
[ ] Application includes at least one of the further exploration objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS.
[ ] Application is well-documented, including specific documentation on further exploration.
[ ] Commit history clearly shows eight hours of work.

#### Further Exploration:

Once you complete the requirements for the code review, consider adding other functionality from Monday’s Further Exploration. Get creative and add other custom routes, scopes and functionality as well. Here are a few other possibilities to consider:

* Add a RANDOM endpoint that randomly returns a park/business/animal.
* Add a second custom endpoint that accepts parameters. Example: a SEARCH route that allows users to search by specific park names.

## User Stories

<!-- * As a scheduler, I want to be able to organize nurses vacation schedules without much paperwork so that I can be more efficient.
* As a scheduler, I want to see a list of requests with the overlapping dates and the nurses that sent in the requests organized by priority so I can see which staff member should have priority in getting the request approved. -->

<!-- * Give stories for people who will use this project and what they'd want it to do.  Can include customers/end users, programmers that maintain code, etc. Use "As a <job title/type of user/etc>, I want to...<what want program to achieve>... so that I can...<reason>.-->
